#  Coding challenges (using ts-node)

A `ts-node` project that solves various coding challenges

Run `npm run start` on the command line to run


##  Linting

This project defines an `npm run lint` command that lints the codebase against typescript eslint rules.  I want to give credit to [https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/typescript/eslint-for-typescript/](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/typescript/eslint-for-typescript/) for helping with this setup.
